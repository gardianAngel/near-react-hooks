# Push NEAR React Hooks to GitHub

## Quick Setup Commands

Run these commands in your terminal to push the repository to GitHub:

### 1. Navigate to the package directory
```bash
cd near-react-hooks-package
```

### 2. Create GitHub repository
- Go to GitHub and create new repository named `near-react-hooks`
- Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
- Copy the repository URL

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
# Add your GitHub repo as origin (using your token)
git remote add origin https://github.com/unyimeabasi/near-react-hooks.git

# Configure git authentication with your token
git config credential.helper store
echo "https://$GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com" > ~/.git-credentials

# Push the code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
