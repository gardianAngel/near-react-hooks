I'd go with the NEAR React Hooks Library - here's why it's the most feasible end-to-end:
Why This is the Sweet Spot
1. Clear, Defined Scope

Hooks are small, focused functions
Easy to test and document
Can start minimal and expand

2. Immediate Developer Value

Eliminates boilerplate code
Standardizes common patterns
Makes NEAR accessible to React developers

3. Manageable Implementation

Built on existing NEAR-API-JS
Leverages React's hook patterns
Can be developed incrementally

Core Hooks to Build
javascript// Essential hooks that solve real problems
useNearWallet()     // Wallet connection/disconnection
useNearContract()   // Smart contract interactions
useNearAccount()    // Account info and balance
useNearTransaction() // Transaction status tracking
End-to-End Execution Plan
Week 1-2: Core hooks + basic functionality
Week 3: Testing, error handling, TypeScript support
Week 4: Documentation, examples, npm package
Why It's "Holy Shit" Worthy

Before: 50+ lines of boilerplate for wallet connection
After: 3 lines with useNearWallet()
Impact: Every React developer can integrate NEAR in minutes
Adoption: Immediate utility for existing projects

This hits the perfect balance of:

✅ Technically achievable in the timeframe
✅ Massive developer experience improvement
✅ Clear, demonstrable value
✅ Builds on proven patterns (React hooks)

The "wow factor" comes from how dramatically it simplifies NEAR integration for the huge React developer community.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.UI want a 3 days end to end execution plan and your going  or the faster routhEdit3-Day NEAR React Hooks Library - Speed Run Plan
Day 1: Core Foundation (8 hours)
Morning (4h):

Set up npm package structure with TypeScript
Create useNearWallet() hook (connect/disconnect/status)
Basic error handling and loading states

Afternoon (4h):

Implement useNearAccount() hook (balance, account info)
Add useNearContract() hook (basic call/view methods)
Write minimal tests for core functionality

Output: Working hooks that handle 80% of common use cases
Day 2: Polish & Expand (8 hours)
Morning (4h):

Add useNearTransaction() hook (status tracking)
Implement proper TypeScript types
Add comprehensive error boundaries

Afternoon (4h):

Create 3 working demo examples (wallet connect, token transfer, contract call)
Write README with copy-paste examples
Set up automated testing

Output: Production-ready package with clear documentation
Day 3: Launch & Demo (6 hours)
Morning (3h):

Publish to npm
Create live demo site (Vercel/Netlify)
Record 2-minute demo video

Afternoon (3h):

Write detailed submission report
Create GitHub repo with examples
Submit to NEAR DevHub

Speed Shortcuts:

Use Vite for fastest setup
Copy proven patterns from existing hook libraries
Focus on developer experience over edge cases
Minimal viable docs with great examples
Leverage existing NEAR-API-JS (don't reinvent)

"Holy Shit" Factor:
javascript// Before: 50+ lines
// After: 3 lines
const { wallet, signIn, signOut, accountId } = useNearWallet();
This execution plan prioritizes working demos over perfect code - exactly what gets sponsors excited. The key is showing immediate, tangible value that other developers can use right away.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.U
