# NEAR React Hooks

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive NEAR React Hooks library that simplifies NEAR Protocol blockchain integration for React developers. The library transforms complex NEAR Protocol operations from 50+ lines of boilerplate code into just 3 lines, making blockchain development accessible to React developers.

The project includes both a complete hooks library package and a demo web application showcasing the library's capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and modern React features
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server for fast development
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components for modern, accessible styling
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management and caching
- **Custom NEAR React Hooks** for seamless blockchain integration

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript for API endpoints
- **RESTful API** structure with `/api` prefix for clear separation
- **In-memory storage** with interface-based design for easy database migration
- **Development/production environment separation** for different deployment scenarios

### Database Architecture
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for PostgreSQL with type-safe database operations
- **Neon Database** integration ready for cloud deployment
- **User schema** with username and password fields for authentication
- **Migration system** using Drizzle Kit for database versioning

### NEAR Protocol Integration
- **NEAR API JS** as the foundation for blockchain interactions
- **Custom hooks layer** that abstracts complex NEAR operations
- **Wallet connection management** with automatic reconnection handling
- **Smart contract interaction** with type-safe method calls
- **Transaction monitoring** with status tracking and error handling

## Key Components

### NEAR React Hooks Library
Located in `near-react-hooks/` and `near-react-hooks-package/` directories:

- **useNearWallet()** - Manages wallet connection, disconnection, and authentication state
- **useNearAccount()** - Retrieves account information and balance with automatic updates
- **useNearContract()** - Handles smart contract interactions with view and call methods
- **useNearTransaction()** - Tracks transaction status with polling and receipt handling
- **NearProvider** - Context provider for NEAR configuration and connection management

### Web Application Components
- **Landing page** with comprehensive documentation and live demos
- **Interactive demos** showing real wallet connections and contract interactions
- **Code examples** with before/after comparisons demonstrating the library's value
- **Professional documentation** with installation guides and API references

### UI Components
- **shadcn/ui component library** with Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach and dark/light theme support
- **Interactive code blocks** with copy-to-clipboard functionality
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback and error handling

## Data Flow

### NEAR Integration Flow
1. **NearProvider** initializes NEAR connection with testnet configuration
2. **useNearWallet** hook manages wallet state and connection lifecycle
3. **useNearAccount** hook fetches account data when wallet is connected
4. **useNearContract** hook creates contract instances for interaction
5. **useNearTransaction** hook monitors transaction status and completion

### Application State Management
1. **TanStack Query** manages server state and caching
2. **React Context** provides theme and NEAR provider state
3. **Local component state** handles form inputs and UI interactions
4. **Error boundaries** catch and handle blockchain-related errors
